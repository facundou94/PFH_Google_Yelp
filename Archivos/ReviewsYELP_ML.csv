uofnRxjiQV94dl1elGhtzw,hjApCn5oMYY_AfLKRtSGbQ,bw90rjFL02A_8rVE34m5Lg,1,15,0,1,"I am reticent to write this review but I really feel like anyone considering visiting this practice should know this.  Its been bugging me constantly over the past 24 hours.  I've moved around a lot for work and so have a lot of experience going to different chiropractors.  I totally believe in the benefits.  I have not received treatment at this facility so in no way do I have anything to say about the quality of the care itself or the passion the DCs have for their work.  The staff in the front was very nice and kind.  The technology is cool and convenient.

That said, this practice is clearly the brainchild of a chiropractor and a timeshare salesperson.  I don't have anything against sales.  I am on the buying end dealing with vendor sales reps everyday for work and everyone needs to make a living.  Where I draw the line is in high pressure sales tactics, being deceitful and making a patient uncomfortable when they say multiple times that they want to consider the enormous investment before committing.  I don't like being pressured to finance treatment when I have already stated clearly 3x that financing is not the issue and I don't need it.  Never in a million years did I think that going for any type of medical procedure would I walk out feeling like I almost got scammed.

What I also didn't like is they tell you it's extremely important to bring your family to the mandatory info session.  It was completely unnecessary for me to bring my overtired toddler and husband to a 7pm 1+ hour presentation on a procedure I've had basically my entire life.  After doing this, I am quite confident they just instruct this in order to remove any possible barrier in the patient saying no to the expensive treatment plan.

What really did it for me is that they made me give my insurance info at the first visit (for which i had purchased a voucher separately), stating that they would check my insurance and present it with the treatment plan at the info session.  My insurance was never even mentioned in the plan, nor reduced off the fee, nor noted in the number of visits.  When I asked, I was told that my insurance only covered 5 visits per year, which didn't sound right to me.  I checked when I returned home and I am covered for 20 visits per year.  I assure you they never even checked my insurance.  They also blast music into the rooms so you can't even hear what the sales person is saying...maybe that's strategic.

The entire experience felt really icky to me and my husband was also, separately, very uncomfortable, even before I went into the diagnosis/sales room by myself (my kid was a complete disaster 45 mins into this so my husband had to leave).

I spent about $40 between the initial visit voucher and xrays (which you have to pay extra to get a copy of by the way) plus about 3 hours of my valuable time wasted just to walk away never even receiving a single treatment!  It's unfortunate because I really wanted to get the treatment but I don't trust this place at all. They may be Christians but it seems like they're on the 'prosperity doctrine' train rather than the Jesus one.  Beware of timeshare scammer sales tactics before you go.",2017-10-19 02:49:21

qn9rnbwnJSgCHuVF8VtPVg,aVkcE9ldp1DnlOAofybfkQ,bw90rjFL02A_8rVE34m5Lg,5,5,3,5,"So I have experienced back pain for many years and wasn't sure what to make of it. Every time I complained about the pain, those around me would make me feel like it wasn't a big deal or would make remarks like ""you're too young to know what that is"". So needless to say, I never did anything about it for a really long time. 

Until recently, the pain became quite unbearable. Simple things like sleeping, driving, and even getting out of bed, irritated me. I knew I needed to see a chiropractor, but when was the question. Over the summer, I went to an event with my aunt at the Fruit and Spice park in the redlands, and came across a vendor table and rep, for New Leaf Chiropractic. After speaking with the rep, she did a quick analysis on my neck, and the results were pretty alarming. I ended up paying to get a consultation done at the office. 

At the consultation, I met with Dr. Richard Rosado. After describing the pain I was in, and his analysis, we then did X-rays. This involved coming back in another day to give him a chance to review them. After seeing the X-rays, I knew my neck and spine were not in good shape, especially for someone my age, and this even affected my hips, leaving one leg to feel shorter than the other. Thankfully I was still in a stage in which it could be corrected with time, and I wouldn't need surgery. 

I was given a treatment plan, and explained the different costs. Now, is it costly? Yes. But what does that mean, that your well-being isn't worth it? I've read many reviews complaining about the prices and so on and so far. By no means am I telling you to spend the money here, and that this is the only place to go. Do your research, absolutely. But after I met with the doctor and saw the establishment, I felt this was the place for me. It's also worth mentioning that they do their best to work with you and the payment plan. The staff is welcoming, friendly, and helpful. I can see the sense of community here and I always feel comfortable when coming. 

I have been coming to this practice now for 2 months, and have a few more treatments left before the end of this treatment plan. My back has been feeling much better. I haven't felt pain when driving, my sleep is better, and I'm not in pain getting out of bed. Now, is my spine and neck issue completely gone? No. But I am well aware that this will take time. It entails utilizing the exercises they have shown me, as well as being conscious of my posture, and the way that I sleep in bed. All in all, I am very pleased with my current results, and look forward to continuing the treatment.",2019-04-02 20:14:25

I signed up and had to pay up front $1500 for services to myself and daughter. I have health insurance but they stated my insurance wouldn't cover. Well after a few months I decided to cancel their services and requested a refund. Not only did they have me going back and forward with them so they could issue me a refund but I'm still missing $153. So apparently my insurance did cover their services and paid them all my visits. I was only responsible for $90. Now I have been calling them and they don't return my calls and if they do they say I owe them for three visits that they never send to my insurance. I never leave feedback but I feel I need to in this case cause they are overcharging customers and get paid twice. By the customer and insurance.,2018-11-07 15:28:58

Compliment: the place is well kept and for the most part really clean (I'm a germaphobe) 

Complaint: I spent my entire ""consultation"" (which this $40 dollar fee wasn't explained to me either when I walked in) joking with my girlfriend that this place sounds like the biggest sales pitch from the moment you enter. However I'm 9months pregnant with no time to spare and checked that they'd take my insurance. They do! Hurray, I'd deal with the cheesy sales pitches and tours of office and posters and knowledge bombs about the spine. 
So after my consultation which I thought would end in treatment but didn't because of the fact that my iPad picture needed to be ""studied"" aka ran through a software and printed for their next sales pitch...they send me on my way to pay for this consultation and schedule an actual appointment for service. I arrange to come back to Kendall for treatment (I live in homestead) 
I walk inside and they take me to the consult room. I CAME TO GET TREATED NOT SPOKEN TO SOME MORE. This other doctor wants to tell me that I need 24 treatments. Cool man, I just came to get adjusted like it was explained to me last time I was here and then has the audacity to tell me about some payment plan of 2 thousand dollars or some absurd plan because they only have one person doing billing and they don't bill daily because if not ""the line would be to Home Depot"" which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard because I was the only human being in there. But anyways this is why I have insurance no? Well we recommend more than your insurance covers. So basically I'm denied treatment because I don't want to pay passed what my insurance covers and I've wasted 2 days of my time trying to get treated. This is terrible business and the most frustrating experience I've had at chiropractic office in my entire life. 

So thank you for wasting my time and $40 which on the website claims that you'll receive a ""complimentary consultation""",2018-11-08 19:08:25

During my first visit an assistant showed me around and I met with a Dr. and they explained to me that in order to fully understand my course of treatment I would need to do x-rays. That piece I understood so with my back pain I went ahead and did the X-ray and paid 60 dollars. Then they told me that they needed 24 hours to read the scan and that the only thing they could do during the first visit was use some metal tool to stretch my back. The man who worked my back also informed me that my problem was muscular. So the next day I went back hopeful that they would help ease my pain as that is what they had promised. However, when I met with the doctor, the doctor informed me that my problem was very serious and spent an hour talking while I was clearly in pain. He then informed me that I would have to pay either 2197 dollars or three installments of 879 dollars! If I didn't pay they wouldn't be able to help my back pain! They also gave me the option of paying and then canceling if I didn't want to return (I am sorry but how can one trust that?!). I have been to other chiropractors and never have I been to one that wanted to talk more than ease someone's pain.",2018-10-26 23:04:46

Summary

For my $20, I received two scans of dubious value, no back adjustment, and was told  another $160 was needed for Xrays and a back adjustment. Not what I was promised.

_________________________
This business was at our local Farmer's Market in Palmetto Bay, offering a free thermal scan on your neck, then offering an initial visit for $20 at their office.. 

This is what was promised:  A complete scan of the spine (thermal and some type of left to right voltage differential measurement), a consultation, an adjustment, then a 2nd scan of the spine that would (hopefully) show the improvements from the back adjustment.

According to them, a $120 value for $20.   Sounds good!

What I received was a tour of the office by  an assistant, the two scans of the spine, then a recommendation for X rays that would cost $120... A second visit to their office was needed, for another $40, when the Chiropractor would review the X rays and perform an adjustment, as needed. Then a long term plan for weekly visits.  It took me this long to realize I've been had.



So for my $20, I received two scans of dubious value, no back adjustment, and an offer to spend another $160 for Xrays and a back adjustment.

Left with my back pain intact.

I would avoid this  business.",2018-04-12 22:48:22

My friend couldn't stop talking about how they were so caring, passionate, and genuine. After multiple adjustments from Dr. Rosado, I now see why my friend wanted me and my family to see them. His chiropractic techniques have helped me a ton!!!!!!!

The approach that they use seems a little bit different than what I normally think of when traditional chiropractic. They don't have to do any popping. Also the technology that the office is very impressive. 

The first couple visits do take about an hour which at first was kind of frustrating but I guess it makes sense that they want to be very thorough when assessing and explaining their findings. 

Overall I'm excited to find an office that is very family friendly, uses advanced technology, and a chiropractor that has really helped me and my family.",2017-03-23 02:51:59

I recently bought the venomous dress from their online shop and it had holes in it, and Nicole helped me but wasn't able to exchange because sizes were out so she gave me a discount and I ended up sewing the holes, luckily the holes were in the back.

Another place told me my brake calipers need to be replaced because they were coming loose so I wanted to get that done too. Came in asked my questions and told them what I needed, Carlos, my cashier, handled it very well. Needed an hour for diagnostics and after about 45-50 mins (on a slow day) they figured out what was wrong. Instead of buying new caliper brackets and shocks the crew told me I just needed some bolts, washers, and some work done on the guiding pins. I also thought that I needed to replace my O2 sensor and to figure that out they had to do another diagnostic test that cost about 80$ but they figured out that the check engine light was caused by something else so they waived the 80$ fee for the diagnostic test. Initially, I thought I was going to spend 800$+ but I only paid a fraction of that. 

Also needed to get my belts done, quoted for about 100 something $ for parts and labor. They got the parts and tried to install them, but they weren't able to since I had aftermarket cams, they called me and didn't charge me anything for that part.

Honestly, this place is a bit pricey but it's cheaper to get the right things done rather than getting things you don't even need. Customer service was excellent, again, Carlos handled everything smoothly and answered all my questions, and the crew knew exactly what they were doing.

If I were a salesperson and someone walked in asking to buy a brand new tire, I would sell that person a brand new tire. Hey, if that's what they want why not give it to them? That's an easy $60-$100, depending on the brand.

Looking back, I have actually done just that at a different Sears auto center. I thought I needed a tire replaced and so I asked for a brand new tire. No questions were asked. They sold me the tire, put it on and I was on my merry way. I will never know if that's what I really needed. This time I was armed with more information. Instead of a brand new tire, I thought I just needed the valve replaced on my existing one. I was given an estimate and was told it would take about an hour. As I walked away from the store to kill time, I was on the phone with my bf and he mentioned that they should do a tank test. Huh? What's that? After hearing what that was, I walked back to the auto center and asked the guy if they were gonna do this test. He said yes and that they were also gonna check the inside of the tire as well. The guy helping me was nice, didn't talk down to me just 'cause I'm a girl, and assured me that they were not going to just replace a part without first checking out the cause of the flat. 

Less than an hour later, my tire was back on my car with a new valve. My spare was put back in my trunk and the charge was a mere $19. Thank goodness I didn't need a new tire!",2011-04-24 21:07:31

After the first visit for ALL of these problems, the ONLY thing that was completed correctly was the oil change, because duh, even non-mechanics can do that. But what about everything else?

1) Check engine light: they told me that it was a problem that only the dealer could fix, so they would leave the light on. But what did they do? They turned it off and now the record/history is cleared! Can't get it fixed now!  

2) Tire pressure light: they left it on. Brought it back in the next day. They left it on again. Brought it in a week later and then they told me that my sensor is broken.... then another mechanic finally turned it off. broken? i don't think so.  

3) Wheel alignment: got it back in WORSE alignment than when I brought it in. Ended up bringing it again the next day, and they were shocked when I told them that I had just gotten it done the day before at their shop! Also, my car makes these rotation noises now, which I told them, but they failed to inspect or care. 

4) Brakes: I told them that it was my front right brakes that were squealing. The mechanic told me that I needed to get my back brakes replaced. I said no, I just got those checked a few months ago and they were almost full. He insisted that the back brakes were the problem, so I gave in and told them to replace it. I got my car back and my right front brakes were STILL squealing! I brought my car back the next day and they insisted that they weren't squealing. I made the mechanic get in my car just so I could prove to them that I wasn't being stupid.

I brought my late model 2009 BMW ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" in for an alignment check and alignment.  Yes, they do use state of the art machine by Hunter systems and they also have this new Rapid Alignment check which they can quickly check your alignment for free in under 2 minutes.  You simply pull up to the bay, they install the sensors and roll your car forward.  Immediately, the computer tells you your alignment.

Fast forward to 30 seconds later, I decided to get an alignment done for $84.99.  I told them I would like them to test drive it with me so that the steering wheel is straight afterwards and such.  In addition, I also know a bit about BMWs.  First, on a stock BMW 3 series, there is something called an alignment pin that is there from the factory!  This pin holds the strut in a particular location so you can't change the camber.  If you do remove the pin, which is only allowed by BMW for excessive camber problem (such as hitting a curb, accidents, etc.), then you could remove it but it creates another problem because the strut is now able to move in the future... throwing off your alignment.  So why do these engineers put these pins in there for the first place?  So you don't touch the camber if you car doesn't have a problem!

The technician who worked on my car, is a joke.  First, he selected the damn wrong profile for my BMW.  I walked into the bay and told him to choose 3 series, 18"" WITH sports package.  A sports package suspension has much more aggressive setup than a non-sports suspension.  What this means is that the ""center"" of each alignment criteria is different.  On a 3 series coupe 335i, the rear camber is center at -1.8 but on a stock non-sport suspension, it is center at -1.4.  See what I'm talking about?

The idiot technician decides to choose the standard suspension.  He wouldn't let me scroll down to tell him to choose the ""Sports Perf Suspension"".  How do I know it exists in the system?  Because I just got a free alignment check in the other RapidCheck system 5 minutes ago!  That profile (template) exists!  This guy has NO CLUE about BMW's. 

Next, this guy decides to pop my hood and begins to hammer my strut.  I told him WTF are you doing?  He wouldn't respond.  He was trying to remove the alignment pin.  I told him to stop, and I told him to NOT touch that pin.  He told me to relax, he knows what he's doing, he's got 3 years of auto experience, blah blah...and that I shouldn't be telling him how to do his job.  I was not telling him how to do his job, I simply told him NOT to change the front camber and to leave that pin alone!  All the alignment shops I've been to in the past, have never touched the front camber and that alignment pin!!  Under no circumstances do one need to remove that pin unless you modified your car, or had a significant accident, or bent some suspension parts.  If I did bent some suspension, one should replace those suspension instead.

After calling the manager over to tell him to select the right profile, he quickly finished up, leaving my car in a sub-par aligned condition.  I took my car to another Sears in Costa Mesa to check the alignment and it was STILL off!  I decided to go to an independent shop, got it fixed.  Then went to Sears in Pasadena and finally the alignment is all correct.

AVOID this place at all costs and do not bring your car here for an alignment.   Just bring your car here for the free alignment checks and then get the hell out of there!",2012-09-24 07:33:25

I brought my 2002 Nissan Xterra into the Cerritos, California Sears Auto Center because my ""Service Engine Soon"" light appeared. The Auto Center conducted a diagnostic check to determine the source of the problem. Initially, the Auto Center informed me the problem was a sensor. The cost for parts and labor was estimated over $700. I agreed for the work to be performed. I spoke to the Auto Center later that day and learned that the problem was not the sensor, but a coolant issue. I was informed by the Auto Center that a Coolant Exchange was completed and the Service Engine Soon light was no longer lit. I was assured by the Auto Center that my problem was corrected. 

A few days later my Service Engine Soon light appeared again. I brought my car into the Auto Center the next day. The Auto Center performed another diagnostic and determined that my coolant was low. I was told the reason the Service Engine Soon light keeps appearing is because I have a coolant leak. This explanation made sense considering I was at the Auto Center the second time in three months for the same problem.  The Auto Center also stated to me that the work had to be performed at another auto repair (i.e. dealership) because their location was not equipped to diagnose or fix the problem. 

I decided to get the Bronze Package (oil change, fuel system flush, 24 point inspection, and tire rotation) considering I was already visiting the Auto Center for the previously mentioned coolant leak.  I left the vehicle at the Auto Center while I visited the mall with my 2 year old. I returned 1  1/2 - 2 hours later to find out that no service was performed and my vehicle was inoperable. The problem arose when the plug was removed to drain the oil from the oil pan. I was informed that a piece of metal from the pan came off when the plug was removed and that the Auto Center could not refill my car with oil. Essentially, I would have to replace the oil pan (a cost of $650) before my car could start. It should be noted that the Auto Center was the last company to successfully change my oil.  If the Auto Center believed the oil plug would potentially lead to pieces of metal breaking off from the oil pan, this information would have been noted in your computerized file. The Auto Center removed the oil plug in an attempt to perform the oil change and rendered my car inoperable. 

I had my car towed from the Auto Center the next morning. After several conversations with Gene Shobe (Auto Center Coach), I was informed that the company will not do anything to rectify the problem (driving into a repair center and not being able to drive out) around 11:30 a.m. I was stranded at the Auto Center with a 2 year old. The oil pan must be replaced before the car can start. The story ended with more than $3,000 in repairs because my gaskets were blown. Take your car anywhere but here.",2011-11-15 07:33:43

I bought groupons for two different cars and took them in and both times I had asked for them to call me when the car was done which took 2 whole hours for an oil change! Both times they never even had the decency to call me when the car was done! Also the groupon stated in clear writing that it included  a complimentary tire rotation, which they didn't even do to my car either, on both occasions as well. On top of everything else they were supposed to do a multiple point inspection on the vehicle. When I asked how the inspection whent they said really well and there isn't anything wrong with the vehicle. After an hour of driving and crossing LA, my car started shaking and making a sound from my front left tire. Worried I stopped and took it to my mechanic who said my brakes were at less then 20%.

I took it to this location because it was near where I broke down. It cost over $3k to have my SUV's engine repaired. A few weeks later back in San Diego my kids wanted to watch a movie on the built in infotainment center (first time since the repairs) but the backseat display wouldn't work. I checked the manual and online to see if I could troubleshoot but no dice. Mind you I'm not car savvy at all but I wanted to see if it was something me or my kids had done. 

Then I recalled the work I'd had done on the car weeks prior and thought to check back with Sears. The guy who answered the phone was rude and treated me like I was stupid for asking if my infotainment center troubles were possibly related to the work that was done. He didn't ask for any details, just told me to go to an auto electronics store. I asked for a manager and after a long hold I get Mr. Ron Stone.

I explained the car situation, he pulled up the repair record, and then suggested it was possible a fuse may have blown during the engine repair. He offered to contact my local sears to set up an assessment free of charge. He sent me an email, to which I responded immediately with the preferred time and location for the assessment. Fast forward three months and three follow-up emails from me later...no response from Ron, no appointment.

They charged my girlfriend $150 for something they broke, they stripped the oil pan on her car while they were changing the oil and all they did to fix it was re-thread it and that's not worth $150 that's the price for another oil pan and I should know cause I grew up with cars and I've been a car enthusiast my whole life.

 So I talked to the manager and complained but all he did was give us a $25 discount which is only a fraction of the cost. They told us that it wasn't their fault but it can't be us since we weren't the one who was doing the job, so who did it? Mother nature stripped the pan? Also they're the only ones who changes the oil on that car since she got it and it happened on their hands. We cant pull the car out since it has no oil and we cant put oil in it without a damn drain plug so we had no choice.

I've changed oil on so many cars and I've never stripped the oil pan on any of them. I have friends that are ASE certified mechanics and they laugh about how idiotic and moronic the management is. Oh also, get this the manager's excuse was that the car has 120k miles. Are you kidding me? I've owned cars with 200k+ miles and they all had their original oil pans.

I asked why so much cheaper.  Priscilla said she didn't know why they were charging twice as much. .  She said they would get the starter from Norm Reeves.  She also told me that their was an 80% chance they could have it done by closing.  I told her I would call her back.  I called Norm Reeves again and asked why Sears could charge half the price and the same guy said, ""  they are probably using some inferior product that is rebuilt.""

I was told that it would take 2-3 hours but that my vehicle would be ready by 1:30 pm. Okay, no problem. I head over to the mall to kill time.

At 1pm on the dot, I call to check if my car is still on track for me to pick it up at 1:30pm. I am told by a lady who answers the phone that not only will it be ready, they are actually ""working on it right now"".  Mind you, I'm at the mall. As a matter of fact, I'm just outside the mall staring at my car from a distance. Yes, it is parked, untouched, and absolutely not a single soul was ""working on it right now."" A straight up, bogus, B.S. answer from the front desk.

I decide to give them benefit of the doubt on this.  Surely, I have at least awakened them to the fact that my car has not been touched and that I'm coming at 1:30 to pick it up. It only takes 15 min. to perform an oil change, after all...

Wrong. I come back at 1:40 pm and to my great displeasure, my car is still parked. UNTOUCHED.  1:50pm.  That's the time my car finally went up on the rack. It's done at 2pm, to confirm my previous estimate of 15 min. for an oil change.

This was so close to being a 1-star review, honestly.  But the technician outback hustled and got the job done quickly once he finally was able to start.  Also, a separate individual upfront was very apologetic for the false information from the lady who answered the phone.  So much so that he didn't charge me for the service.

The salesperson Priscilla was very nice about checking me in & getting what I needed she made me feel comfortable enough to trust them with my car. However when I picked up my car it was nightmare! They dented the rear quarter panel of my car, I immediately notified them, they took pics of the incident they said they would contact me after their insurance got back to them. I called to follow up the Manager Ron (who is 100% unprofessional)  Said he had no information and  was not notified of the incident. He said he would return my call in 15 min when he looked up his report. One week went by and I never heard from Ron, so I decided to call him back. This time around his insurance adjuster was not in & that he had no information again! really!? Now I'm angry, the Auto Center's Mangers or in this case Ron, has not made any further attempt to contact me it has been 4 months.

I work for Uber, and my car needs an oil change.  Uber prides itself on providing discounts with partnered companies.  One such indirect relationship is Sears, through ""Shop Your Way"".  I haven't done much research on the relationship and how else ""Shop Your Way"" provides services, but I am not sure it matters for this review.  

Amongst the various auto care providers was Sears -- and they offered, and I quote:  ""50% off of auto services""  INCLUDING oil changes.  I was glad it was specifically mentioned.  So, through the linked app, I made an appointment for an oil change today.  Regular price $49.99, so one would assume I will pay $25.00 or so plus tax.

I go in, and at first they tell me that they cannot honor this because my account isn't ""linked to"" ""Shop Your Way"" (I was glad they at least were familiar with this service and company.)  So I insist that I did indeed link them.  Oh!  They find me when I confirm my email.  Then he hands me all this paperwork to sign showing that I will be paying $54.00, because ""the ACTUAL special is $75.00 (and he shows me this price)....  Oh, no, I mean.... uh... so you are getting full synthetic, which is $75... and uh... you'll be paying $54.00 with the discount.  But I have not applied the points.   Part of this amount will be paid with points.""  

OH how deliciously CRYPTIC you are, Sears!!

""So, how much will I actually be paying in dollars?""  I ask.
""We won't know until we are done with the oil change, how many points we will be able to apply...""

HUH????  I say, i say i say, ""HUH?""  What points, Sears?  Where exactly do these magical ""points"" come from?  Do we pull them from the universe and apply them, but they are invisible until AFTER the universe sees that the oil change is done?

I say:  ""I did my research before this appointment. And I had other options. I made an appointment for a $49.99 oil change that would get a 50% discount, but somehow I am paying $54?""

His explanation:  ""Yeah, your car cannot take a synthetic blend.  It must be full synthetic.""  At this point I asked for my keys and left.  I had an appointment elsewhere for $45.  With NO discount... so why would I put my business with what is essentially a liar?

Because here's the thing, Sears.  If this Full Synthetic is $75 (I saw it with my own eyes), 50% of $75 is NOT $54.  
Furthermore, this whole ""we won't know all the points to apply until AFTER we have done the oil change (and when, obviously I am stuck paying regardless of how far you have bent me over, because one cannot ""undo"" an oil change.) -- is ridiculous.  I have no points.  On what basis are these points?   Are they like Jack's magic beans?

It is needless to mention details about the DJ's we interviewed prior to learning about Joyful Noise but they made us realize the distinct concept of professionalism. Mr. Mitchell possesses the qualities of professionalism and integrity; so rare these days. In terms of his fees, they are extraordinarily reasonable compared to competition and for the quality and quantify of effort he applies.  We even had 'homework';  it was a great collaboration necessary to produce an amazing memory. Having Mr. Mitchell as the master of ceremony (MC) for our wedding reception meant we literally did not worry about one moment; all the time and depth of research he dedicated to us showed. When you want your guests to be respected, you may not want to worry about inappropriate situations.  Mr Mitchell kept everything in tact. With his wealth of knowledge, there were numerous unique and unforgettable moments he created for us and the guests. Mr. Mitchell made us the superstars throughout the evening but made our guests feel involved.  Everyone had fun and commented to us throughout the reception and for weeks to come how impressed they were with Mr. Mitchell. They were amazed at how stunning his voice is and his orchestration of each moment (cake cutting, bouquet toss, etc.) performed to perfection.  We certainly should say more and will always feel gratitude for all Mr. Mitchell did to contribute to the success of our wedding.

Rqu21HdvnZP983Fl-QpN-Q,-DHmZEcMo2dWh97PFLktxA,ZG3sntPpL5mEebogPDid_w,3,1,0,0,"*Overview*
Project contact/overseer: Jacob (rating 2.5/5)
Workers: Robert + 1 guy whose name I didn't get (rating 5+/5 stars) 
Quality of work done: Great (rating 5+/5) 

*Experience*
I hired Energy Green Builders to configure a small room adjacent to the master bedroom into a walk-in closet and configure wiring at the front of the house for a wired doorbell. Jacob was my point of contact. He gave me a quote for this body of work and a timeframe of 2-3 days. I was satisfied with the timeframe and price considering I would be able to move seamlessly from my bedroom to my own walk-in closet AND have a working doorbell (we don't always hear visitors knocking). 

The closet portion required the existing door (from the hallway) to be closed off and a new opening added into this room from the master bedroom. On this opening I had double barn doors installed. There were also a few electrical outlets moved along with the light switch to better fit the new configuration of the room. I am beyond happy with the workers who did the job and how everything turned out. They were amazing and cleaned up everything after each day of work! 

My only issue with how this project turned out was my communication with my contact Jacob. Due to various holidays there were days when he was unavailable. I respect the need to observe holidays or take time off for whatever reason BUT there should be someone I can contact during the project if something comes up. The other issue (also shrouded in poor communication) arose when the guys were done with the closet area. They informed me that they were not equipped to configure the necessary electrical elements at the front of the house to support a doorbell...they would essentially have to bring wiring from the breaker box at the back of the house to the front of the house, which they were not at all comfortable doing as they themselves were not electricians. I am eternally grateful for this honesty on their part and I was not at all surprised by the process of getting wiring to the front of the house. However, in EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION I had with Jacob, I was told that the doorbell would indeed be installed and that it would be done last. For this reason I believed that someone with the necessary skills would be assigned to my project. It wasn't until after the workers expressed that this was not their expertise that Jacob finally admitted it was not possible in the agreed upon timeframe (which in total took about 5 days of actual work and a few communication breakdowns which led to workers not showing up one day). He said that the doorbell was much more complicated and would be better as a separate project. That would have been absolutely fine except for the fact that our contract price was based on one doorway being closed off, a new doorway being created, AND a wired doorbell being installed. This was agreed upon in writing. When I mentioned this and requested that the price be adjusted to account for the doorbell not being completed, Jacob proceeded to haggle with me and only knock off $200 from the overall price. This is the sole reason for not giving this entity a 5 star review. 

Communication is extremely important! When getting work done on the most expensive thing I own (my home), I expect timely, accurate, professional communication. Jacob's communication was sort of timely and mostly professional (until the last day) but it was not accurate. If you are the person overseeing a job, and you commit to giving the customer a quote, it is your job to make sure the workers who show up are equipped to do the work. If the two guys handling the closet were not able to do the doorbell wiring, no worries - just find someone who can so that you deliver what was promised to the customer. Otherwise, let the customer know before signing a contract that its not possible with the available resources.  When you give the customer a quote, it should include enough to cover your overhead and make whatever money you need to make. I should have been notified earlier that all the contract deliverables were not possible so that we could have reviewed the price prior to the day of project completion. At the end of the project is not the time to be inflexible with a price adjustment when you fail to deliver what was outlined in the contract. 

*LESSONS LEARNED* 
 
- Communicate, ask questions, get second opinions! If you are getting improvements/work done to your home and you're a first time homeowner like me this is important! I will do this to the nth degree as I roll into other home improvement projects from my list. I'm glad I started w/ a small project because it was a good learning experience but I will not be hiring or recommending this com",2018-10-18 21:27:41

We wanted the popcorn ceilings removed, the walls repaired, some drywall work, and finally, everything painted in our four level townhouse. This was a big job.
Ron Golde came to our house a delivered a wonderful presentation. Being a retired engineer, his detailed overview impressed me.
This is where the fun ended.
I was introduced to a job overseer named Manny who scoped things out to me to my satisfaction.
This was the last time I saw Manny.
The young gentlemen who showed up to start the job were under-skilled and under no supervision. While I was mentally prepared for the popcorn ceiling removal to be a messy job, I was NOT prepared for the incredible mess that was being created. They started painting unprepared bathroom walls, not filling any holes or performing minor repairs.
I had Ron Golde remove them from the job, voicing my great concerns about the low level of skill and job know-how I was receiving.
They were replaced by better skilled workers, one named Alex who performed admirably.
Much of his time, however, was fixing poor workmanship errors.
A two week job ended up taking four weeks.

I give this job an overall rating of B-.
And that's a kind B-.
For that, I cannot and will not recommend Energy Green Builders.
I got a handyman job for a handsomely professional price!
Ron Golde showed up after the job was declared done to do a personal inspection.
This took all of ten minutes.
He told me he would send a professional cleaning crew to do a detailed cleaning of our house.

They first carefully covered all the walls, floors, and furniture and the filled cracks so the walls were back to their original form.  They took their time taping so that the paint lines were distinctive.  They used two coats of the Benjamin Moore Aura paint, which gave the walls luminosity and incredible depth.   When our color choice for paint in one room didn't work as we had hoped, Ron and Ezra told us it was no problem and covered the walls with the new chosen color.
